# Project: Preparing Data For SQLite

The Academy Awards, also known as the Oscars, is an annual awards ceremony hosted to recognize the achievements in the film industry. There are many different awards categories and the members of the academy vote every year to decide which artist or film should get the award. Each row in our data represents a nomination for an award. The database file, nominations.db, contains just the nominations table.

## Context 
This project is part of Dataquest.io guided projects. Datasets were provided and we were asked to make data exploration in Jupyter Notebook. Each project were constituted of 6 to 8 steps of exploration, analysis, visualization and sometimes machine learning algorithm implementation. Additional steps were given at the end of each project to advance our exploration. The text cells between each code cells are part of the instructions that were provided. It is slightly retouched. For example, instead of 'you', it has been replace by 'we' to improve readability. 

## Install
This project requires Python 3 and the following Python libraries installed:

- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [sqlite3](https://sqlite.org/download.html)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html).

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. Make sure that you select the Python 3.x installer.

## Code
All the code is in the notebook `creating_relations_in_sqlite.ipynb`.

## Run
In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory Visualizing-Pixar-s-Roller-Coaster/ (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```
jupyter notebook creating_relations_in_sqlite .ipynb
```

or
```
ipython notebook creating_relations_in_sqlite .ipynb
```
This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your web browser.

## Data
The dataset used in this project is included as `nomination.db`.
